## Tasks
- Set the custom daisyUI theme `Claude` as active by adding `data-theme="Claude"` to the `<html>` tag.
- Ensure the Tailwind plugin directive is correct by adding a trailing semicolon to `@plugin "daisyui";` in `src/index.css`.

## Scope
- Only these two changes; no dark/black mode configuration will be added.

## Validation
- Run the dev server and verify that base colors (e.g., `bg-base-200`, `text-base-content`, `btn`) reflect the `Claude` palette.

## Deliverables
- Updated `index.html` and `src/index.css` with minimal, safe edits.
- Short verification summary with the active theme confirmed.
